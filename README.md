# Corporate Event Planner

## [Deployed with Netlify](https://tender-goldstine-b2ea23.netlify.com)

### Description
#### Pitch: 
App to keep track of all your corporate event planning details! There are so many details and people to coordinate with. This app helps solve these problems.

This app contains one user type- a corporate event planner.  
* Onboarding process for event planner. Include their company, role and e-mail.
* Home Page - After a user logs in, they'll be directed to their page where they can view cards of their past and current events they are planning. They can click into an event to view full screen or edit or delete info.
* Navigation - Navigation is present on all pages.
* Create Post Page - Allow a user to create a new event to plan.  New event fields might include event name, description, date and time, and budget. You can add a list of vendors you need to maintain relationships with, and create a shopping or to do list with the ability to mark off items as done. When saved you can view a preview of the event on the homepage.
* Single event page. View a single event in full screen. Include functional buttons to edit and delete data.  View the to-do list/shopping list, and list of vendors.  

Stretch Goal: Invite other co-workers by e-mail to join the project, with ability to edit it as well. On the single event page, add ability to add comments to each vendor on the list to track conversations and notes.

# Product Canvas

### What problem does your app solve?

> This app will allow the event planner to log in and see the events they are currently planning, as well as review past events.

### Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

> The Corporate Event Planner site will consist of a marketing landing page. This site will also include an app that will have a login page landing page.

When the user clicks on an event it will go to a single event page, in which the user can see more about that event, edit, or delete data.

We have a vault of Lifestyle Adventure packages that our Creative team has designed to take celebrating occasions to a whole new level of turn up!

### What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?

I'm not sure about the top 3, but these are the top 3 from doing a simple search.

- https://gogather.net/ - Team works with local and global destinations. They have a nice landing page. I don't see any login ability. The "Services" link does not work. The "Our Work" Link has cards with different events planned and information about those events. "Contact Us" has a form, phone number, email, and address to contact the company.

- http://raglandproductions.com/ - This site does events with inflatable rental. Landing page with contact information at bottom of the page. "Attractions" link includes cards for the different inflatable options for rent or things for purchase for an event. This company focus is more for planning an event for the families of a company or for church / school events.

- http://www.thedetailsevents.com/corporate -- This site offers more than corporate events. Looking at the corporate event page, they have a nice landing page. They have a link to "Free Consultation" however it is not working. They do have a contact page, in which you can select a consultation time. They have a blog about events, and a gallery of pictures from events. Clicking a picture in the gallery takes you to more information about that event.
